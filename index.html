        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
        Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as         preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.
        A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In mlaborum dolorum.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.[2]

        Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancie</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word in Nahuatl called tlacahuapahualiztli. It means "the art of raising or educating a person",[6] or "the art of strengthening or bringing up men".[7] This was a broad conceptualization of education, which prescribed that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by community living. Historians cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone regardless of social class and gender.[8] There was also the word neixtlamachiliztli, which is "the act of giving wisdom to the face."[7] These concepts underscore a complex set of educational practices, which was oriented towards communicating to the next generation the experience and intellectual .</p>
